            <h2>Terms & <span>conditions</span></h2>
            <p>
                •	Carcinogenic Substances like Alcohol and Cigerates are banned on our events. <br>
                •	Activities like trekking depend on various factors like hiking speed of trekkers and how long the trekkers spend time at the summit, all our schedules are tentative because of these factors as some trekkers like to spend more time and have fun. <br>
                •	Weather conditions, permission changes and wildlife movements are completely random in these kinds of activities we might change the itinerary a bit to deliver you an adventurous experience or cancel the experience and we’ll offer you a full refund. <br>
                •	We expect the trekkers to not expect luxurious facilities as most of the places we go are remote areas and be ready for a new adventure experience. <br>
                •	We offer a pickup point which is nearby to your area, arrangements to reach the pickup-points are to be made by the trekkers itself. <br>
                •	For cancellation of your slots, you’ll be charged a small refund fee. <br>
                •	 Rage will not be responsible for any loss of belongings during the experience duration. <br>
                •	Privacy in tech is growing into a pressing issue. After the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the risk of data breaches and inappropriate use of personal data has become obvious even to those who hadn’t ever considered the need for privacy before. That’s why we don’t collect or sell any form of data when you visit this site. <br>
